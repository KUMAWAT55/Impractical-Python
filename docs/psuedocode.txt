A very high-level pseudocode for our funny name generator could look like this:
STEP 1 : Load a list of first names
STEP 2 : Choose a first name at random
STEP 3 : Assign the name to a variable
STEP 4 : Choose a surname at random
STEP 5 : Assign the name to a variable
STEP 6 : Print the names to the screen in order and in red font
STEP 7 : Ask the user to quit or play again
STEP 8 :  If user plays again:
            repeat
          If user quits:
            end and exit
