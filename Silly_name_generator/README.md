#### SILLY_NAME_GENERATOR

In this warm-up project, you’ll write a simple Python program that generates nutty names by randomly combining first names and surnames. With any luck, you’ll produce a plethora of aliases that would make any sidekick proud. You’ll also review best-practice coding guidelines and apply external programs that will help you write code that conforms to those guidelines.
